## 🌟 Mission

LipiPala AI is an open-source initiative dedicated to preserving, documenting, and revitalizing endangered Indian languages using artificial intelligence. By combining advanced NLP, speech recognition, and community collaboration, we aim to create accessible tools for indigenous communities to preserve their linguistic heritage.

## 🗣️ The Challenge

India is home to over 1600 languages, with UNESCO identifying 197 Indian languages as endangered. As these languages fade, we lose not just words but entire knowledge systems, cultural practices, and unique worldviews.

## 💡 Our Solution

LipiPala AI provides a comprehensive platform that:

- **Documents** native speakers through audio/video recordings
- **Transcribes** spoken language to text using custom speech recognition
- **Translates** between endangered languages and major Indian languages
- **Teaches** through interactive learning resources
- **Preserves** cultural context alongside linguistic data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dearabhin/lipipala.git
cd lipipala

# 2. Install dependencies using Poetry
# This will create a virtual environment and install all packages from pyproject.toml
poetry install

# 3. Run the development server
# This command executes the main entry point within the Poetry-managed environment
poetry run python lipipala/main.py
```

## 🧩 Core Components

- **Data Collection Module**: Tools for recording, uploading, and organizing language samples
- **Speech Recognition Engine**: Custom models for endangered language speech recognition
- **Translation System**: Neural machine translation between endangered and mainstream languages
- **Web & Mobile Interface**: Accessible platforms for communities and researchers
- **Learning Resources**: Interactive lessons, games, and resources for language learners

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Core infrastructure, initial models for 5 endangered languages
- **Phase 2**: Mobile app development, expanded language support (15+ languages)
- **Phase 3**: Community building, offline functionality, advanced cultural context preservation
- **Phase 4**: Self-sustaining language ecosystem development
